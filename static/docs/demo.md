### 驾幸三会寺应制
释子谈经处，轩臣刻字留。
故台遗老识，残简圣皇求。
驻跸怀千古，开襟望九州。
四山缘塞合，二水夹城流。
宸翰陪瞻仰，天杯接献酬。
太平词藻盛，长愿纪鸿休。

## Project description

Flask is a lightweight [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/) and [Jinja](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn’t enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy.

## Installing

Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```python
pip install -U Flask
```

## A Simple Example

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
$ env FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
 * Serving Flask app "hello"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
